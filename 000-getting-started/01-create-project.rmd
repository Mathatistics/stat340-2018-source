# Getting Started

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = eval, comment = NULL)
eval <- TRUE
ans <- TRUE
```

We will use a dataset containing body measures of about 400 persons as an example set to practice our RStudio skills.

## Exercise 1: Create New Project
Creating a project allows us to organize the files and related materials during our study. File => New Project opens a window to create new project. It will be easier to access all the resources, if all the scripts and datasets are within a main folder, i.e. the project folder.

The examples in this exercise uses the project folder as the main folder. Although it is not necessary, but throughout the exercises we will use `_data` folder as a folder containing all the data that we are using in the course.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = knitr:::is_latex_output(), purl = FALSE, fig.cap="Creating Project in Rstudio"}
library(htmltools)
div(
  id = "project-screenshot",
  img(src = "images/NewProject-1.png"),
  img(src = "images/NewProject-2.png"),
  img(src = "images/NewProject-3.png"),
  img(src = "images/NewProject-4.png")
)
```


```{r create-project-gif, out.width = "100%", eval = !knitr::is_latex_output(), fig.cap="Creating Project in Rstudio"}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/Create-Project-Final.gif")
```
