# Getting Started

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = eval, comment = NULL)
eval <- TRUE
ans <- TRUE
```

In this secion, we will dive into R and RStudio and get used to with it to some extent. We will continue learning about R and RStudio as we go on. R is an open source programming language basically used in data analysis. In R there are many packages that are created for specific purposes and they have made R rich and powerful. In this course, apart from default R package (that is installed and already loaded), we will use few other packages which we will install and load as we go through our exercises. We can use following command to install a package. Below, a `car` package is used as an example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("car")
```

To load the package we use `library` function as,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(car)
```

Following screenshot help you to install package using RStudio IDE,

```{r install-load-package, out.width = "100%", eval = !knitr:::is_latex_output(), fig.cap="Creating Project in Rstudio"}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/install-load-package.gif")
```


## Exercise 1: Create New Project
Creating a project allows us to organize the files and related materials during our study. File => New Project opens a window to create new project. It will be easier to access all the resources, if all the scripts and datasets are within a main folder, i.e. the project folder.

The examples in this exercise uses the project folder as the main folder. Although it is not necessary, but throughout the exercises we will use `_data` folder as a folder containing all the data that we are using in the course.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = knitr:::is_latex_output(), purl = FALSE, fig.cap="Creating Project in Rstudio"}
library(htmltools)
div(
  id = "project-screenshot",
  img(src = "images/NewProject-1.png"),
  img(src = "images/NewProject-2.png"),
  img(src = "images/NewProject-3.png"),
  img(src = "images/NewProject-4.png")
)
```


```{r create-project-gif, out.width = "100%", eval = !knitr:::is_latex_output(), fig.cap="Creating Project in Rstudio"}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/Create-Project-Final.gif")
```
