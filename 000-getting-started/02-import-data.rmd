## Exercise 2: Importing data in R

The usual data sources can be a text file in `txt` or `csv` format or spreadsheet(excel) file in `xls` or `xlsx`. Data and R-objects can also be imported from `rds`, `rda` or `rdata`. Below, we will discuss these in detail. In addition you can also find some animated images showing how we can import data in RStudio for each of these file formats.

### Import `txt` or `csv`
Base R-package has `read.table` and `read.csv` for importing a text or comma separated file (csv) files. Download `bodydata.txt` and to import it in R as,

```{r, echo = TRUE}
bodydata <- read.table("_data/bodydata.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", dec = ",")
```

Here the argument `header` is `TRUE` if the data has header in its first row. The argument `sep` takes `\t`, `,` or `;` based on if the columns in the text data are tab-separated, comma-separated or separated by semi-colons. If the decimal values in the data are represented by `,`, the `dec` argument takes the value `,`. For further help see: `?read.table`


```{r import-text-gif, out.width = "100%", eval = !knitr:::is_latex_output(), fig.cap="Import text data"}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/Import-Text.gif")
```


### Import Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
An R-package `readxl` helps to import excel file. If it is not installed, you should install it as,

```{r, eval = F, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("readxl")
```
Download `bodydata.xlsx` from canvas and load it to R as,

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(readxl)
bodydata <- read_excel("_data/bodydata.xlsx", sheet = 1)
```

For further help and arguments on this function load the library as `library(readxl)` and see: `?read_excel` or `?read_xlsx`.


```{r import-excel-gif, out.width = "100%", eval = !knitr:::is_latex_output(), fig.cap="Import data from Microsoft Excel"}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/Import-Excel.gif")
```

### Load `rdata`, `rda` or `rds`

One can save data, models and other R-objects in `rdata` or `rds` format. In order to load `rdata`, we can use `load` function. Download `bodydata.rdata` from canvas and load it to R.

```{r echo = TRUE}
load("_data/bodydata.Rdata")
```


```{r import-rdata-gif, out.width = "100%", eval = !knitr:::is_latex_output(), fig.cap="Import data in Rdata format"}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/Import-Rdata.gif")
```

### Reading data from clipboard ("pasting" copied data into an R object)
You can import data in clipboard in R. For example the data you copied in Excel or Word files.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
bodydata <- read.table(file = "clipboard", header = TRUE)
```

In Mac, you need to do,

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
bodydata <- read.table(file = pipe("pbpaste"), header = TRUE)
```

This allows us to get the data from anywhere just after they are copied.


```{r import-clipboard-gif, out.width = "100%", eval = !knitr:::is_latex_output()}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/Import-Clipboard.gif")
```

After every import in above examples, we have saved our imported data in `bodydata` variable. This an R-object that holds any kind of data-structures such as `matrix`, `data.frame`, `list` or fitted models. We can find these R-objects in "Environment" tab in RStudio.
