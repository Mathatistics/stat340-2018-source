## Exercise 5: Exploring the data

### Structure of an R-object
The first command you need to learn is `str` function in order to explore any object in R. Lets apply this to our `bodydata`,

```{r str-bodydata}
str(bodydata)
```

This output shows us that `bodydata` is a `data.frame` with `r nrow(bodydata)` rows and `r ncol(bodydata)` numeric variables - `r names(bodydata)`.

### Accessing elements from R-objects
Different [data structure](#03-data-structure-in-r) have different way of accessing elements from them. 

#### Extracting elements from `vector`, `matrix` and `array`
For vector, matrix and arraywe can use `[` for accessing their elements. Lets create a vector, a matrix and an array as follows,

```{r}
a_vector <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
a_matrix <- matrix(1:24, nrow = 3, ncol = 8)
an_array <- array(1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4))
```

**Extracting element at position 3 to 5 in `a_vector`**
: `a_vector[3:5]` with give <code>`r a_vector[3:5]`</code>, the elements at postion index 3, 4, and 5. In R, position index starts from 1.

**Extracting element in rows 2, 3 and columns 2, 4, 6, 8 from `a_matrix`**
: This is a two dimensional structure, we give row-index and column-index inside `[` operator separated by comma as,
```{r}
a_matrix[c(2, 3), c(2, 4, 6, 8)]
```
We can also write this as,
```{r}
a_matrix[2:3, seq(from = 2, to = 8, by = 2)]
```
Here `seq(from = 2, to = 8, by = 2)` create sequence even integer from 2 to 8 which is used as column index for extracting elements from `a_matrix`.

**Extracting first element of `an_array`:**
Here `an_array` is an array structure of dimension three. So, we have to use three index vector inside `[` operator in order to extract element from it. For instance `an_array[1, 1, 1]` gives `r an_array[1, 1, 1]` as its first element of the array.

In all these structures we can only supply index of one or more dimension. For example,
`a_matrix[1:2,]` where we have only mentioned the row index, will give elements in _first_ and _second_ row from all columns. i.e.
```{r}
a_matrix[1:2, ]
```

#### Extracting elements from `data.frame` and `list`
Lets create a `data.frame` and a `list` as,
```{r}
a_dataframe <- data.frame(
  fertilizer = c("Low", "Low", "High", "High"),
  yield = c(12.5, 13.1, 15.3, 16.2)
)
a_list <- list(
  facebook = data.frame(
    name = c("Gareth", "Raju", "Marek", "Franchisco"),
    has_profile = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
  ),
  twitter = c("@gareth", "@raju", "@marek", "franchisco")
)
```

**Extracting third and fourth row of `fertilizer` from `a_dataframe`**
: Same as extracting elements as matrix as discussed above we can use row and column index as `a_dataframe[3:4, 1]`. We have used `1` in place of column index since `fertilizer` is in first column. We can also use name instead as `a_dataframe[3:4, "fertilizer"]`.
```{r}
a_dataframe[3:4, "fertilizer"]
```

**Extracting first element of `a_list`**
: We can use `[[` for extracting elements from `a_list`. For example `a_list[[1]]` will give the first element of the list. Here in our list we have two elements with names `facebook` and `twitter`. So, we can also use their names as `a_list[["facebook"]]` which is not possible if they do not have any name.
```{r}
a_list[["facebook"]]
```

We can also use `$` operator to extract elements from named list and a data frame. For example, `bodydata$Weight` extracts `Weight` variable from `bodydata` dataset.

### View Data in RStudio
Newer version of RStudio support viewing data in different structures. To view `bodydata` we have imported in [Exercise 2: Importing data in R], we can use `View(bodydata)`. If you have not imported the, you need to follow the exercise and import the data first. We can also click the data in "Environment" tab to view it.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="View dataset using command and by clicking the data in Environment tab", eval = !knitr:::is_latex_output()}
knitr::include_graphics("gif/View.gif")
```

### Summary of data

We can compute basic descriptive summary statistics using `summary` function as,

```{r}
summary(bodydata)
```

### Dimension of data
The number of elements in a data structure like vector and list we can use `length` function. For example: if we extract `Weight` variable from `bodydata` we will get a numeric vector. The length of this vector is,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
length(bodydata$Weight)
```

A multi-dimensional data structure like matrix, array and data frame has dimension. We can use `dim` function to find the dimension.

```{r}
dim(bodydata)
```

Here, the first and second item refers to the number of rows and number of columns of bodydata. Similarly, we can use `nrow(bodydata)` and `ncol(bodydata)`to obtain these number individually.

### Lets Practice
1) Take a look at the top 5 rows of `bodydata`
2) Take a look at the top 5 rows of `Height` and `Circumference` variables of `bodydata`
3) Apply `summary` function on `Age` variable of `bodydata`
